Steps to reproduce:

1. Run the preprocess script on the dataset (train and test).
2. Run the preparation script on the processed dataset.
3. Run the "whisper_lora_train" file to train the model on the dataset.
4. Run the test script to evaluate the fine-tuned model. (Also run it on the base model if you don't know the base models performance on the dataset)
